# My Body Mass Index Calculator

For my challenge, I had to build out this body mass index calculator page and make it look as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge. So, if I had something I wanted to practice, I was free to give it a go.

I aimed for my users to be able to:

- Select whether they wanted to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
